# acl:trustedApp

This document is currently a placeholder for future work on the `acl:trustedApp` predicate.  There is some debate in a [previous discussion](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/pull/1) on whether we should address this predicate in this spec.

This predicate is not part of the ACL vocabulary and is not described in the WAC specification. I would recommend omitting it.

However acl:trustedApp is in use and is kind of central to the current app ecosystem. Hopefully we can think of a way to document it while pointing to alternatives.
