### Things we should consider (EP=Elf,AV=Angelo,JZ=me)

* EP: don't require oidcIssuer, say OIDC is currently widely used and where it is used the Solid-OIDC spec requires it (JZ:yes)

* AV: drop requirement for solid:SolidProfile; (JZ:yes)

* AV: refer to WebID and OIDC specs rather than rewrite the rules (JZ:yes)

* AV: support private Profile Document (JZ:probably no)

* AV: support multipe Profile Documents (JZ:no)

* AV: support multipe Preference Files (JZ:no)

* AV: should apps be required to read triples that have WebID as object e.g. `schema:Event schema:performer <?WebID>.` either in Profile Document of seeAlso? (JZ:maybe not?)
