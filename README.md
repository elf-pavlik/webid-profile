# Solid WebID Profile

This repository holds materials related to the proposed Solid WebID Profile specification.

## Overview

 The [Solid WebID Profile specification](https://solid.github.io/webid-profile/) describes the discovery process and data model of a Solid Profile, representing a social agent's identity within various usage scenarios and application-specific preferences.

## Goals

The goals of this group are:

* to define a data model to express identities within a social, conceptual, and contextual relations in order enable socially-aware decentralised applications.
* to make recommendations and guidelines based on adequate implementation experience, as well as a framework for specialisation and extension of existing specifications.
