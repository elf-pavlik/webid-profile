## Notes 

Some questions from Jeff :

* omit TLS?
  * is this section relevant anymore?
* other agent types
  * software - we should at least mention these exist, possibly document them?
  * group - we should emphasize and document this
* storage discovery
  * if it isn't in profile, describe walking tree to find storage
  * talk about why/how to have multiple storages
* solid:oidcIssuer
  * possibly irrelevant for discovery, but should document need for it in profile

In some places in the old documetation use the phrase "gets created by default on account creation" - this may not be true
