## Topics

### Updates

* VB: Working on conformance from what was discussed two meetings ago.
* TT: Same.
* JZ: Working on a redesign of SolidOS. Profile extractor that could work on command line. Works very well within system that SolidOS currently uses: TIs, predicates, etc. Can be easy to modify. Will demo that to you if interested.

### Public/private keys on WebID Profile

* AB: Trying to implement private an public key on WebID because we need it for Solid chat but don't know how we can access it. Profile, TI, or something different? Private and public key related to a WebID, not to an app or app type, so it is rather high level. Has been implemented by chat app but related to the app. If you change app you have a different pair key. I was to keep the same key.
* JZ: Off the top of my head it would go same place as oidc-issuer, so the public part would go on the profile and private file in preferences file.
* AB: problem is in the profile you have many public keys.
* JZ: I don't know the domain but if possible to have multiple you can have multiple triples.
* TT: Not aware of any implementation but from security perspective feels odd to have private key in any way linked in a pod. That said, we're not going to tackle this particular endeavor on our specification. We're merely specifying what is already in place. To solve this problem we should discuss on SolidOS with people that have more knowledge on security. Whatever you choose would be a proposed solution for the future. We need to make sure the solutioon we choose is decent from security POV.

### Protecting oidc-issuer on NSS

* JZ: NSS should disallow updates on solid-oidc issuer predicate. There's an issue on that: <https://github.com/solid/solid-oidc/issues/219>
* VB: Are you suggesting NSS do it / separate topic?
* JZ: Yes.
