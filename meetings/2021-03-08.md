## Topics

- Emelia Smith's suggestion to add `foaf:accountName` to WebID Profile Document
  - show the account name to users in accessible format
  - use finger format for eventual possible interop with finger
    - user@idp
  - Sarven suggests use of foaf:nick instead
- Knowledge transfer from Sarven on spec language

  - wac spec, 2021-07 is one example to base from
  - separate non-normative from normative
  - terminology should be defined
  - if exists in previous spec, copy definition or redefine; link back to original spec
  - ontologies are authoratative so can use terms without redefiing
  - e.g. we don't need to redifne e.g. seeAlso
  - Use "when" - _when_ an app wants to X, it must Y ...

- Do we want to allow putting `acl:trustedApp` triples in `seeAlso` documents
  - Unaddressed due to time constraints. Will be addressed in upcoming sessions.
- ESS and `isPrimaryTopicOf`
  - Unaddressed due to time constraints. Will be addressed in upcoming sessions.
