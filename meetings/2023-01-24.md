## Topics

### Update on current work on SHACL shapes

URL: <https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/pull/84>

* VB: Shape still under review, incorporating feedback as reviews come in.
* VB: Also currently working on adding Data Model section to the spec and improving the Introduction section. Will PR soon.
* AH: I was thinking "what is a profile?" Maybe ask Tim what is minimal. Is there anyone else?
* VB: Maybe Sarven, put everything in an example folder to PR them individually.
* AH: i will create a PR for each example.
* VB: next I will work it into the spec.
* ME: can someone that the typeindex is mandatory for a profile?
* VB: I cannot think of nothing that should be mandatory. Still, you could have a working profile that does not need it. We should have example with and without.

### TypeIndex shapes

* TT: just a note: this is done now, but haven't merged because I need to do a last validation on some productive TI file (for example, mine). Suggestion from Tim. Otherwise looking good.
* TT: Made two PRs (sub-topics below). Sarven made comments. Agree with him on intro but not on abstract.
* TT: I will restructure and reedit some points in the content about TI. Feel free to read and review.

#### TypeIndex Abstract chapter

### Examples of WebID-Profiles

* AH: One of examples should be a minimal profile. What is a minimal profile? Do we have something written down or decided on this?
* TBL: Minimal in what sense?
* AH: When a solid server creates a new WebID-profile, what is the least amount of triples it needs to describe for it to be a profile.
* TBL: For it to be function it needs a name and a picture.
* AH: Is there no definition or consensus about this?
* TBL: There is not. If we were to have one, there would be more. Require picture/name. From technical POV, SolidOS can add any of the stuff that it needs (TI, etc) but server doesn't need to create it.
* AH: then if no consensus I will create an issue and invite people to discuss. I plan to create a new account in different servers and see what is generated. Then I can ask around, TBL, Sarven, and other people who might be interested.
* TBL: Solid servers have the ability to create the things they miss.
* AH: There will be a lot of optional fields, but from technical standpoints there is very little that is required.
* TBL: There's a label function which will make up a name. We can do the same with mugshot.
* AH: It is possible to say a picture is required and the server needs to provide something.

ACTION: AH to create issue about minimal profile.
