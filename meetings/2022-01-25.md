## notes
 * main topic of the meeting: What is the interop pannel doing and what do they have in regards WebId?
    * Conclusion: we would like to bring both work more together like puzzle pieces. 

* Justin explained in detail their work. He shared more documents and diagram and explained them in detail:
  * Authorization flow: https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#authorization-flows
  * About Social Agents: https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#social-agents
  * Code to exemplify: 
    * [https://github.com/janeirodigital/sai-java](https://github.com/janeirodigital/sai-java)
    * [https://github.com/janeirodigital/sai-js](https://github.com/janeirodigital/sai-js)
* from what was presented we think we do not have any impplementation collisions but both can, in worst case, co-exist. 
* we will further check abozt trusted apps and typeIndex if it is so.
