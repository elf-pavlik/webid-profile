## notes
 * main topic of the meeting: What is the goal we want when engaging with others in regards to our WebId work?
    * Conclusion: our goal is to document the practices that exists, in code, right now. 

*  "document the practices that exists, in code, right now" means implementation that can be demostrated, code that exists and is published in open applications

* the WebId-spec team explains that it decided to tackle the task in 2 ways:
  * from the point of the structure of the profile. This brings up questions like: how can a person have multiple WebIds? How are the connected? How can a person have multiple storages? How does one keep some information private?
  * from the content of the profile: which information goes in a profile?

* for now, the team focuses on the structural questions because they seem more important to understand. 

* some advice was given:
  * try to explain what a WebId is, understand how we got here. Maybe talk to Henry Story about it.
  * focus on what is meant to publish a WebId, istead on focusing on servers
  * what is the barrier to participate in the ecosystem?
  * what are publishing practices?
  * where can an app find information?
  * maybe formulate it more generalistic than saying look in the preference file compared to follow the predicate x.
  * it is good to check that what we come up with can co-exist with other solutions out there.
