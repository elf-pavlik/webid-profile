### acl:trustedApps

* VB : concerned about privacy - anyone can see the apps a user trusts
* TT : concerned about ability of app to self-declare the user trusts it (e.g. grant itself Control)
* TT : concerned about ability of an app with pod-wide Write to delete the entire pod
* JZ : OTOH, on my home computer any app operating as me can also delete my entire file system
* JZ : most common concern from Aaron, and others is that origin can be spoofed
* JZ : if solidcommunity.net moves to CSS and CSS dosen't implement trustedApp, the section will apply to almost no one
* JZ : there is no spec on how apps get authorized; each server does it differently; it shouldn't be the reponsibility of the profile spec to decide how apps get authorized

ACTION:

We decided to ask NSS developers to document trustedApps and point to that documentation rather than inlcuding a section on trustedApps in the spec.
