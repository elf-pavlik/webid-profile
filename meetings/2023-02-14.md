## Topics

### Change in meeting time

* VB: Proposed by TT
* VB: It might be tricky to find time.
* TT: Half an hour sooner?
* VB: I can't, have conflicts with Inrupt meetings. I think the only day I am free at this time (or around) is Monday, but what we can do is have a doodle with your availability, and then share with others and decide. My other concern is that we have reasonable overlap with US timezones, so we might have to keep it in the afternoon hours.
* TT: other proposal: keep the meeting 30min only. :)
* VB: the problem with that is that, sometimes we can get by with 30 mins, but many times we need more time. So I think we should keep the full hour.
* TT: tough.
* VB: calendars are a nightmare.
* TT: if I make a doodle I don't know what availability to put it.
* TT: let's keep this timeslot for now with me only for 30min.
* VB: Most of the times we get through main topics in the first half hour.
* TBL: Do we have any urgent tasks ??? TypeIndex spec is more urgent because of the discussions abotu it.

Decision: stick to current time for now.

### Open PRs that need feedback

#### Type Index

URL: <https://github.com/solid/type-indexes/pull/9>
URL: <https://github.com/solid/type-indexes/pull/10>
URL: <https://github.com/solid/type-indexes/pull/12>

* TT: These are PRs for abstract, introduction, Type Index chapter. TBL, you're welcome tor review. Only open to-do is community chapter. Then we can merge and give it a last pass. And then type index will be done and I can shift focus to profile.

#### WebID Profile

URL: <https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/pull/84>

* VB: This is the shape PR. Specifically need more opinions on open comments.
* VB: There are also things to add (oidcIssuer, for example). Please suggest other predicates that should be added.
* TBL: To have reactions to comments, there is code for that. In the Solid UI code..
* TT: I think that's a programatic thing, not ontology/scheme thing. I think this is just JS with an icon.
* TBL: Its action which is a social action where you put yourself as the person who did the action.. and the target can be anything.
* TT: Is there RDF attached to that?
* TBL: Yes, it is written into the chat.

* TT: This is not a profile thing, it's an application/chat thing.
* TBL: Wouter wanted to have the ability for people to like things.
* VB: And to have that discoverable from profile?
* TBL: Public list of things you like. Like bookmarks. And have reactions.
* TT: But that is not the function of a profile.
* TBL: Whenever I go to anywhere in SolidOS I get a note saying I have more than one bookmark file.. public likes would be like bookmark files and then we need to decide where they go.
* TT: Are the bookmarks linked to the webid profile?
* TBL: My guess is no.
* VB: So that for example I can have a twitter-like app where I can display all the "likes" a user has?
* TBL: Correct.
* TT: To sum up on Wouter's question, I think we're going with a different direction on that.
* TBL: Type Index probably works for bookmarks.
* TT: Okay. That's a conclusion for that topic.

* VB: Abstract rewrite.
* VB: Thanks Timea for feedback. Sarven also left extensive feedback which is very useful and I will incorporate both ASAP and then move on to Intro. TBL, if you could review too that'd be great.
