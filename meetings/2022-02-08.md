## notes

* The main goal is: Tim explaining typeIndexes today.

* we start with the diagram: <https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/blob/main/diagrams/type-indexes.svg>
* when uri ends with #me is the profile document but these links (typeIndex) could also be present in the extended profile
* profile is public and contains a preference file which is not public (but private)

* in the preference file we have preferences for languages, and chat and whatever we want private
* there are 2 typeIndex files: public and private (categorized by type)
* publicTypeIndex is in the profile and the privateTypeIndex is in the preference file
* privateTypeIndex keeps track of my contacts for example (see diagram for AddressBook)
* in solidOS in chat there are 2 checkboxes for preferences of the chat and those are than recorded either in the public or private typeIndex files (public link to this chat)
* solid:TypeRegistration -> can only be used with Solid, it expresses that in this context there is a think - link to a community for example
* through solid:Community you can go and find your addressBook from you being a member of a community because it follows links to the organization itself (see dotted arrow in diagram) (you travel accross address books)
* solid:instance is linking to the actual resource
* caching the titel of the instance is good for human readable format.. question is in what language
* what is solid:instanceContainer for movies and things. -> there are 2 ways to operate either point to resource or to a folder/container
* with shapes one could validate the typeIndex file. see: <https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/blob/main/shapes/profile-shapes.ttl>
* additional validation files for profile: <https://github.com/inrupt/pod-browser/tree/main/shapes/profile> and for contacts: <https://github.com/inrupt/pod-browser/tree/main/shapes/contact> and one for typeIndex: <https://github.com/inrupt/pod-browser/blob/main/shapes/profile/person.shex>
* make sure there will be a diagram for it which refelcts all predicates
* shapes - are generated from forms for now
* is the human readable lable a must for the shapes?
* for now it is optional - if there is no label it should look it up or choose a best guess

* do we in our work need to provide shape validation?
* answer: yes
* one can convert from forms to shacl or from ttl to shex
* is typeIndex mandatory?
* if you do not have one your pod is quite poor - no apps
* if an app you want gets installed and you do not have a typeIndex the app should create it
* a console info should be there to tell the dev but if it is not it 'must' be created
* typeIndex is a 'should' be there in the pod recommendation
* if the preference file does not exist the typeIndex
* is there is a typeIndex it can also be empty - no record is expected
* our target group is the developer - should, must may is for the developer!
* a solid:TypeRegistration; and solid:forClass schem:Movie; need to be there together and then either a solid:instace and solid:instanceContainer
* you can have multiple instances in the same resource 
* code example in solidOs: <https://github.com/solid/solid-ui/blob/520c493ea4777b0d3ce2fc0c501e68331fc45815/src/authn/authn.ts#L347>
* we want a notion on setting prefferences of resources created
* if there is a private note - it should be added to privateTypeIndex
* a private set of tools described in typeIndex and have something that says: this is a prefered application - for example in a chat when you have a... and you click on the dots
* a lot of customization can go in preferences but with typeIndexes one can do even more - add tools to a community one is member of
* recommendation for devs what should happen upn uninstall - or deletion
* example when deleting the movie container - giving the option to the user to chose what to delete out form teh typeIndex
* <http://paymentpointers.org> -> is this still needed? (was intended for donations) -> ask Michiel? a good example to leave the final validatino file open. A validation file is closed to be used for testing or maybe also for cleaning up.
