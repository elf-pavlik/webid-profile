## Topics

### TypeIndex Shapes
URL: https://github.com/solid/type-indexes/pull/5
 * Lets discuss the shapes.

* TT: Does this capture what the community and/or Tim wanted. Need to talk to him. There is a suggestion from WT.
* TT: Open question from WT. Can you summarise the idea for improvement?
* WT: Has been in my mind for a year now. Saw the shape and it came back to me. We hold type-indexes like a file, and then we take it for granted that by convention it has a number of registratoins but no links to data between type registration and entities so it may be useful to have a new predicate for formalise it.
* TT: To make implicit knowledge explicit as I understand it?
* WT: Yes.
* TT: Okay with me. Concerns: what's implemented and borderline adding something new. I want to think about the consequences in the SolidOS - don't it should TBH. The rest is to check with team's feedback.
* WT: We could add the predicates and optional link to shape and then it doesn't affect the validation. In the future we could switch to require but it doesn't disturb anything in the meantime.
* TT: Will think about it how to do that. Perhaps we can close off the first pass of shapes.
* AH: Could be like versioning, one optional and then later required.
* TT: Will keep an eye on that how it lands in the end.
* WT: Can discuss further in the issue/PR.


### WebID Profile examples
URL: https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/issues/83

* VB: Proposed by AH.
* AH: I think it can be useful to add some examples. Just wanted to raise this in the meeting to hear who might contribute them.
* AH: Do people have bandwidth to add examples or should I do this?
* AH: have minimal example for required and maximal for optional, and various alternative shapes.
* TT: +1. Not everyone can read shapes but people can Turtle.
* AH: Can add a folder example and have Turtle examples in there.
* VB: Go for it.
* TT: Is this applicable for the type-indexes as well?
* AH: Some examples are there already but should be some for ???
* TT: I'd like to keep it separate so that they can be used as a class, and the other would be examples.
* TT: The one about writing the spec is going to be probably me, the examples could be anyone.
* VB: Either works.
* WT: Suggestion: in the interop panel we create example Turtle files and then in the spec we include code blocks from those example files, so the examples in the spec are always in some parts from the examples we give.
* TT: About the learning process.
* SC: Another approach which I think looks better: live code. Link to something that's working.
* TT: Do you mean in the specification itself?
* SC: When an implementer looks at the spec, they want to get a sense of how htings work and they might copy/paste and change some values for their code or plug in the URLs in their app or curl and see how something works in reality. The closer that is to working code, there is a better sense of something accurate / usable or used.
* AH: Process I was thinking is to link to SolidOS. Copy examples and switch out variable that need to be changed.



### WebID Profile SHACL shape
URL: https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/pull/84

* VB: Based off: https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/blob/main/shapes/profile-shapes.ttl
* VB: A few comments/reviews came in. More welcome.
* VB: This is based on what Tim put I think last year. Not sure what others think
* AH: Resembles PodBrowser?
* VB: I out what I had for PodBrowser in a PR. I intend to use that work too. I can share the link to that PodBrowser shape in case anyone wants to reference it.[PodBrowser shapes](https://github.com/inrupt/pod-browser/tree/main/shapes)


### TypeIndex further work
* TT: I intend to rounding up the spec text more. Listing up the document class and Introduction. Maybe there'll be content for the next time around. Help welcome / at least with typos. Fan of typos :)
