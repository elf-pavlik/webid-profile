## notes

Topics on the agenda:
### Regarding solid:Community/solid:Organization
* 1) release 1st version of profile spec with WHAT IS now implemented (not includ solid:Organization)
* 2) add Communities to 1st profile spec because it was already underway (inlcude solid:Organization)
* Points of discussion:
* how about writing it our in an appendix first
* the reason is to be faster in writing out the first version
* agreement to keep it as second prio - we will at least copy the discussion in markdown to have it for later

### Clarify solid:privateTypeIndex predicate
* where it can exist?
* Points of discussion:
* NNS puts it in the webID profile doc upon creation so we have to describe it as it is now.
* in solidOS code we actually make a difference and the private one is in preference files: <https://github.com/solid/solid-ui/blob/ea33598dce93d43d9a960c114f9d08be648003e9/src/authn/authn.ts#L349>
* if load is looking in both places then it will never operate well
* for reading it would mean to change all NSS
* same applied to seeAlso and sameAs (see next topic)
### seeAlso and sameAs links - where must app look for them?
* maybe we should not recommend that it is a necessity to follow them - not every app should follow these links
* is anyone who implemented the usage of extended profile? Use case: when you have an account whith no write access - then it might be useful
* which brings us to the next topic (public/private profile documents)

### public/private profile documents
* The interop panel is [discussing WebID documents that are not publicly readable](https://github.com/solid/solid-oidc/issues/80) ... do we want to say that the Profile Document (whether or not it is the same as the WebID Document) SHOULD be publicly readable?
* Tim: the profile MUST be publicly readable
* but should the webID document be publicly readable or not?

### Types (solid:ProfileDocument,solid:Organization,etc.) - include now?
* separate question from Communities which is a more complex issue
* See: https://gitter.im/solid/profile-spec?at=620b9c8d3e52f56a2606792d
* proposal: to keep this in for better explanation of the webId profile
* team agrees to put it in the 1st version

### Listed/Unlisted type registry index resources -> same as public/private
* do we even need this wording?
* Proposal accepted: drop listed and unlisted wording.

### Any timeplan ahead when we release a draft version of the spec?
* discovery, personal & organisational
* discovery most important for developers - fairly close to finish - trustedApps and typeIndexes
* Jeff: draft of discovery part - within 30 - March 20th.
* What do we mean by discovery: storages, preference, typeIndex, trsutedApps, oidcIssuer, seeAlso, difference bwteeen webId and profile doc -> relate to structure of data rather than identification.
* solid:oidc missing information should not block us - we should be clear on it now already.

### Shape files
* Tim creted for us some shape files  on personal profile content. Organizational is still a TODO
