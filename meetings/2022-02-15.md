## notes

Topics on the agenda:
### Regarding solid:Community/solid:Organization
* 1) release 1st version of profile spec with WHAT IS now implemented (not includ solid:Organization)
* 2) add Communities to 1st profile spec because it was already underway (inlcude solid:Organization)

### Clarify solid:privateTypeIndex predicate
* where it can exist

### Types (solid:ProfileDocument,solid:Organization,etc.) - include now?
* separate question from Communities which is a more compllex issue

### seeAlso and sameAs links - where must app look for them?

### public/private profile documents

The interop panel is [discussing WebID documents that are not publicly readable](https://github.com/solid/solid-oidc/issues/80) ... do we want to say that the Profile Document (whether or not it is the same as the WebID Document) SHOULD be publicly readable?

### Any timeplan ahead when we release a draft version of the spec?
